      "Top Gun Maverick box office day 1 collection: Tom Cruise's film collected $51 million at the US box office on its opening day. In India, it collected ₹4.75 crore. Top Gun came out in 1986, establishing Cruise, then 24, as an action hero. He’s nearly 60 now, promoted to US Navy captain in the sequel, and working hard to recreate the magic from 36 years ago.Director Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun Maverick, which features Tom Cruise, had a contrasting opening at the box office in India and the US. In the US, the film collected $51 million on its opening day. The film is already Tom’s best opening day ever beating Mission Impossible – Fallout's first-day collection. However, the film has not been able to make a mark in India and collected ₹4.75 crore on day one. In Top Gun Maverick, Tom essays the role of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who is grappling with the diminished standing of fighter pilots in a world that now wages war with drones controlled by people miles away on computers. Top Gun Maverick is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie and David Ellison.As per a Deadline report, Top Gun Maverick at this Friday night hour is on its way to a $51 million opening day (which includes $19.3 million previews). It would not be shocking to wake up on Saturday morning and see that the sequel has edged out Iron Man 2 ($51.2M) to become Paramount’s top opening day ever. Already, the sequel is Tom Cruise’s best opening day ever in US/Canada besting Mission: Impossible – Fallout‘s first day of $22.8M by 124%.",

He sat next to me and curiously asked about the laptop I was using. “It’s a Surface Laptop Studio,” I replied. “Does Microsoft make its own laptops?” He admitted he wasn’t aware of the Surface brand but told me he liked the form factor of the Surface Laptop Studio. “It’s different from my MacBook Pro,” said the man who introduced himself as the owner of an architectural firm. This conversation just reinforced my belief that there will be takers for Microsoft’s experimental Surface Laptop Studio, which blends certain elements of the desktop Surface Studio and the premium 2-in-1 Surface Book. It’s a mobile workstation that’s also a sketching slate and a portable home theater. I have been using the Surface Laptop Studio for a few days, and I am in love with this device even though it is not perfect. Here is my review.",

It helps in numerous ways, be it in improving flexibility, strength and posture, or reducing stress and providing a sense of calm. Nutrition and diet are an important part of fitness along with physical exercise. On that account, it becomes necessary to understand whether yoga should be done on an empty stomach or notAnshuka Parwani, a yoga expert, and Pooja Makhija, a nutritionist took to Instagram to talk about this dilemma that many face.Pooja believes that it’s important to have something before starting with your exercise in the morning. It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that. On the other hand, if it feels like you need something to get a better start, follow that as a part of your routine.    ",

People want to kill me and they tell me so every day. People want to put my baby in the microwave, and they tell me that. She also said, I live my life with these sets of rules I've to follow, my friends have to follow for me not to have a panic attack or a triggering event or I relive the trauma, even from training to do. In my movie, for instance, for training for Aquaman, a combat scene and a trigger happen. I have a meltdown and have to deal with that, the crew I work with have to deal with that, because of the damage I walk around with every single day. I am not sitting in this courtroom snickering. I’m not sitting in this courtroom laughing, smiling, or making snide jokes. I’m not. This is horrible. A jury is scheduled to hear the closing arguments on Friday in Johnny's lawsuit against Amber. Each side will have two hours to summarise their case in a trial that has stretched on for six weeks.

You upload a photo of a face, check a box agreeing to the terms of service and then get a grid of photos of faces deemed similar, with links to where they appear on the internet.

PimEyes found one reporter dancing at an art museum event a decade ago, and crying after being proposed to, a photo that she didn’t particularly like but that the photographer had decided to use to advertise his business on Yelp.

      "Artificial intelligence in healthcare is an overarching term used to describe the use of machine-learning algorithms and software, or artificial intelligence (AI), to mimic human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and comprehension of complex medical and health care data. Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions based solely on input data.The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between clinical techniques and patient outcomes.[1] AI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. What differentiates AI technology from traditional technologies in healthcare is the ability to gather data, process it, and produce a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through machine learning algorithms and deep learning. These processes can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. To gain useful insights and predictions, machine learning models must be trained using extensive amounts of input data. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: once a goal is set, the algorithm learns exclusively from the input data and can only understand what it has been programmed to do, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are black boxes; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but offer little to no comprehensible explanation to the logic behind its decisions aside from the data and type of algorithm used",

In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI.

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. Since then, as the cost of solar electricity has fallen, grid-connected solar PV systems have grown more or less exponentially. Millions of installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations have been and are being built. Solar PV has rapidly become a viable low-carbon technology, and since 2020, provides the cheapest source of electricity in history.",

They are said to be the best way to provide nutrition to the body and boost immunity. Every season comes with a variety of grains, vegetables, and fruits and we can’t agree more that they are tastier than the stored ones. However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic.",

      "If you are a fitness enthusiast and a vegan, you might be one of the people who have tofu in their meals instead of paneer. While many people find it easily in the supermarket, others may find it difficult to spot tofu at their local stores. If you are one of those people, don’t worry as this simple method can help you make protein-rich tofu at home with just two ingredients – chickpeas and water.Once the tofu is set, you can use it as and when required. It is as tasty as the tofu bought from a store and tofu is as versatile as cottage cheese. It can be used in dry and wet recipes depending on your mood and diet requirements. Chickpea is rich in protein and hence the tofu is a great source of protein to help you complete the daily protein requirement.Soak the chickpeas overnight after thoroughly washing with the help of a strainer under running water.Drain all the water and wash the chickpeas the next day. Add chickpeas with two cups of water in a blender and blend in batches until you have a smooth mixture.Strain the blended chickpeas through a muslin cloth into a bowl. Make a squeezable bag out of the muslin cloth with the mixture in it. Squeeze the blend well to strain it nicely. As the water drains slowly from the mixture, it takes some time to strain the blend.Take the strained blend and put it in a pot. Keep the pot on full flame and let the mixture boil. Once you see bubbles, lower the flame and cook the blend for another half n hour. The mixture will thicken with time. When it is thick enough, put off the flame and let the blend cool down for a while. Leave the mixture in a container for more than 2 hours idle. This will ensure that the mixture sits and the tofu sets properly",
